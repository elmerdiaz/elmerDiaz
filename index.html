          <p>
                My name is Elmer I graduated from Galileo High School in 2017. 
                And I now go to City College of San Francisco. I know how to speak Spanish and English. 
                Right now I work as a cashier at the pier 39, I’m always interacting with people around the world when I’m working. 
                I do know some of the python language, I’ve done small programs like calculating your average of how many times you ride the bus per week or in a month.
                I also created a Rock Paper Scissors game.
                One thing I do want to improve on is building data structure I want also know more about the security and algorithms.
