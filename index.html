          <p>
                My name is Elmer and I've graduated from Galileo High School in 2017 and now enrolled at City College of San Francisco. I am fluent in both Spanish and English. Right now I work as a cashier at the pier 39, IÕm always interacting with people around the world when IÕm working. Also, I do know some of the python language, IÕve done small programs like calculating your average of how many times you ride the bus per week or in a month. I've also created a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. One thing I do want to improve on is building data structure and also learning more about algorithms.
